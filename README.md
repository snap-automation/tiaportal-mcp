# TIA-Portal MCP-Server

A MCP server which connects to Siemens TIA Portal.

## Features

- Connect to a TIA Portal instance
- Browse and interact with TIA Portal projects
- Perform basic project operations from within VS Code

## Requirements

- __.net Framework 4.8__ installed
- __Siemens TIA Portal V20__ installed and running on your machine
- Check if under `Environment Variables/User variable for user <name>` the variable `TiaPortalLocation` is set to `C:\Program Files\Siemens\Automation\Portal V20`
- User must be in Windows User Group `Siemens TIA Openness`

## TIA-Portal Versions

- __V20__ is the default version.
- Previous versions are also supported, but must use the `--tia-major-version` argument to specify the version.
- Export as documents (.s7dcl/.s7res) via `ExportAsDocuments`/`ExportBlocksAsDocuments` requires TIA Portal V20 or newer.
- Import from documents (.s7dcl/.s7res) via `ImportFromDocuments`/`ImportBlocksFromDocuments` also requires TIA Portal V20 or newer.

## Known Limitations

- As of 2025-09-02: Importing Ladder (LAD) blocks from SIMATIC SD documents requires the companion `.s7res` file to contain en-US tags for all items; otherwise import may fail. This is a known limitation/bug in TIA Portal Openness.
 - `ExportBlock` requires a fully qualified `blockPath` like `Group/Subgroup/Name`. If only a name is provided, the MCP server returns `InvalidParams` and may include suggestions for likely full paths.

## Testing

- See `tests/TiaMcpServer.Test/README.md` for environment prerequisites and test asset setup.
- Standard command: `dotnet test` (run from the repo root).
- Test execution policy: offer to run tests, but only execute after explicit user confirmation. Details in `AGENTS.md`.

## Contributing

- See `agents.md` for guidance on working with agentic assistants and the test execution policy (offer to run tests only with explicit user confirmation).

## Error Handling (ExportBlock)

- The Portal layer throws `PortalException` with a short message and `PortalErrorCode` (e.g., NotFound, ExportFailed), and attaches `softwarePath`, `blockPath`, `exportPath` in `Exception.Data` while preserving `InnerException` on export failures.
- The MCP layer maps these to `McpException` codes. For `ExportFailed`, it includes a concise reason from the underlying error; for `NotFound`, it returns `InvalidParams` and may suggest likely full block paths if a bare name was provided.
- Consistency required: TIA Portal never exports inconsistent blocks/types. Single export returns `InvalidParams` with a message to compile first. Bulk export skips inconsistent items and returns them in an `Inconsistent` list alongside `Items`.
- Standardization: Exception context metadata is attached in a single catch per portal method right before rethrow, not at inline throw sites. See `docs/error-model.md`.
- This standardized pattern currently applies to `ExportBlock` and will expand incrementally.

## Transports

- Supported today: `stdio`
  - Program wires `AddMcpServer().WithStdioServerTransport()`.
  - For stdio, logs must go to stderr to avoid corrupting JSON-RPC.
- Available via SDK: `stream` (custom streams)
  - The SDK exposes `WithStreamServerTransport(Stream input, Stream output)` which can be used to host over TCP sockets or other streams.
  - Not wired in this repo yet.
- HTTP/Streamable HTTP: not implemented yet
  - The current ModelContextProtocol .NET package in use (0.3.0-preview.4) does not provide an HTTP server transport out of the box.
  - Plan (see TODO): add `--transport http`, `--http-prefix`, and `--http-api-key`, host with `HttpListener`, and route POST `/mcp` to the MCP handlers. Later align with MCP Streamable HTTP spec.

- Example mcp.json, when using VS Code extension [TIA-Portal MCP-Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JHeilingbrunner.vscode-tiaportal-mcp) and TIA-Portal V18
  ```json
  {
      "servers": {
          "vscode-tiaportal-mcp": {
          "command": "c:\\Users\\<user>\\.vscode\\extensions\\jheilingbrunner.vscode-tiaportal-mcp-<version>\\srv\\net48\\TiaMcpServer.exe",
          "args": [
              "--tia-major-version",
              "18"
          ],
          "env": {}
          }
      }
  }
  ```
